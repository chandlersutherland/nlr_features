# nlr_features
Scripts associated with understanding the genomic features of NLRs (expression, methylation, and TE distance). 

Each feature has a corresponding directory, containing scripts run on UC Berkeley's High Performance Computing Cluster, and any associated individual job scripts. All figures were generated using the scripts in figure-generation, as well as described statistical tests.
