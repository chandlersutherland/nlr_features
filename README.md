# nlr_features
Scripts associated with understanding the genomic features of NLRs in Arabidopsis (expression, methylation, and TE distance), as well as the signatures of selection acting on NLRs. All methods described in the preprint: [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.12.523861v2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.12.523861v2)

Each feature has a corresponding directory, containing scripts run on UC Berkeley's High Performance Computing Cluster, any associated individual job scripts, and post processing. All figures were generated using the scripts in figure-generation, accompanied by described statistical tests. Intermediate data files are stored in the data directory, and the final data displayed in each figure is in the source_data directory.
