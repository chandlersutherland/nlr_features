# nlr_features
Scripts associated with understanding the genomic features of NLRs in Arabidopsis (expression, methylation, and TE distance), as well as the signatures of selection acting on NLRs. All methods described in the preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.12.523861v1

Each feature has a corresponding directory, containing scripts run on UC Berkeley's High Performance Computing Cluster, and any associated individual job scripts. All figures were generated using the scripts in figure-generation, accompanied by described statistical tests.
