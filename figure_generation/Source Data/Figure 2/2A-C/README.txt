Numerical source data in per_NLR_features.csv includes: 
- 'Gene' with the Arabidopsis Col-0 gene name as of Araport11
- 'HV' with highly variable status
- 'log2_TPM' with log2(TPM+1) from rosette leaf tissue 
- 'meth_percentage' is the %CG methylation from rosette leaf tissue
- 'te_dist' distance to nearest TE in kbp
