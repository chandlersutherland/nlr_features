# Figure 1: mean entropy per gene in Col-0 
Numerical source data in Col0_mean_entropy.csv includes: 
- 'Gene' with the Arabidopsis Col-0 gene name as of Araport11
- 'HV' with highly variable status coded as a binary, 0=non-hv, 1=hv 
- 'name' with common gene name, if present 
- 'mean_ent', the mean across gene Shannon Entropy calculated per Col-0 sequence
