# figure_generation
All figures were generated in R studio. 

Each `.Rmd` file contains all the code necessary to recreate the figures, either from Zenodo intermediate files or from the `Source Data` directory in this repository and published with the paper. The `Source Data` directory is organized by figure number. All statistics reported are generated alongside their figure generation. 

Each `.md` file was generated from its corresponding `.Rmd`, but is more user friendly to view in github and displays the plots alongside the code. The plots themselves are saved in the `./figure-gfm` subdirectories.
